first web application
expression langauge 
scriptlet
disadvantage of using get and through parameter take the password
how to create form
and how to redirect multiple jsp page
form validation like username and password
redirect to multiple servlet
how to formate todos list

what is jstl
ans> jstl java standard tag library,it provide a lot of standard tag that help us 
to write code in jsp very easily. 

ques: diff between session scope variable and request scope variable 

imp Note: when we send multiple requsest then what ever send in previous reques are lost
is nothing but what ever attribute thair in earlier request which are lost 
by the time is next request are send thats the resion why the jsp in will not display name.


note: adding functionalaties like hwo to add new functionalaties

note: add delete functionalities in this project
 
bootstrap :- is a very popular css framework for devloping responsive application
it is a combination of both which helps us to format the application
and able to deblop responsive applicaiton
 so work with bootstrap we need to app web jars like bootstrap and jquery dependencies in pom.xml
 after that we need to add jar locaiton to jsp page then it will work 



NOTE:-> PROBLEM when i send the request without login then able to access the page how to solve the problem
ans-> 
-> what is the logic we can use?

-> where can we implement the logic ?


/*
:-> Filter:-> java ee provide the filter ,where  interset all the servlet 
LoginRequestFilter
*.do

implement like that 

if there is a name in session 
  we will allow the request go through as usual
  else 
  we would redirect to login page 

ques:->hwo to delete logout functionalities

         ------>INPORTANTY THEORY---->
         
maven :-> maven is a java build tool when ever if we wnat to do java web application
then lot of steps that are building the archive
1> maven install -> compile the all the code 
2> packging the web app 
3> this command will create war file



---------> servlet life cycle ------------>

init() method --------> is executed only once,when the servlet started and when the first request comes init method will we called  
service() method -----> each of servlet calls service mehtod is called 
    so it looks as the request method -> see whether is the get request or post request add invoke approprate doget dopost or dodelete method 
     if those method are not define service method will throw an exception  
destroy() method------> is executed only once, call when the server is close

    doGet() ---------->
    doPost()---------->
    
 note--> see method hirerchy in predefine class then press fn+f4 then you will see
 
    
   -------> Architecture of java web application----->
  
  Model 1 Architecture(initial version)
  ====================
  only have jsp all the things will we thair in jsp page only
  
  Model 2 Architecture(MVC)
  ====================
  Servlet - controller 
  jsp   - view
  Model  - Todo
  
  controller ---> control the flow , controller decide which model object to lode ,which model 
  object to bring in and which view should be reandered
  
  --------in Spring mvc ------->
  Front Controller - spring mvc - Dispatcher servlet
